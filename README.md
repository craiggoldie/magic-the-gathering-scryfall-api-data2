# ScryFall API Data Analysis: 2
This builds on the previous repo about getting scryfall data--it develops the way the data is curated; then it analyses the data.

Just crack open the Jupyter notebook above titled 'scryfall_v4.ipynb'. Ensure you also have 'portfolio.csv' (with same columns as this repo) and a 'cache' folder for all the code in the notebook to work.

This repo is referenced by my website article at 

The data are analysed in three ways:

1. Prices are analysed to identify arbitrage opportunities
2. Price movements are analysed to predict future value and inform buy decisions
3. Portfolio prices are analysed to recommend sell decisions
